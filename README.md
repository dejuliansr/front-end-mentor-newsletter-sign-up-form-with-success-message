## My process

In this challenge I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript didn't use any framework so as not to complicate the configuration

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I was able to learn various important concepts in front-end web development. I will understand how to create a semantic HTML structure, use Flexbox for responsive layout, and manage images and text well. In addition, this challenge taught me CSS applications such as the use of color, spacing between elements, as well as visual effects such as shadows and corner radii to create an attractive appearance, and I also learned the application of JavaScript which I used for email validation and successful mpdal popups when email entered successfully. Overall, it helped improve my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
